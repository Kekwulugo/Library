# Library

## Project Description
This project allows you to create a digital library where you can store information about books you are currently reading or have already read. You can indicate the books read status and leave each book a review. This branch contains the same functionality but I have used classes to refactor the main code

# Technology Used
This project was built with HTML, CSS and vanilla JS. I was able to practice classes
